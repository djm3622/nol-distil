# Diffusion Distillian via Fourier Neural Operator Learning

This repository is the code base for the **Diffusion Distillian via Fourier Neural Operator Learning** (the name may change), which aims to distill high resolution diffusion models with neural operators, providing one unified model across all sub-spatial dimensions.
