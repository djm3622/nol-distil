# Diffusion Distillation via Fourier Neural Operator Learning

This repository is the code base for the **Diffusion Distillation via Fourier Neural Operator Learning** (the name may change), which aims to distill high resolution diffusion models with neural operators, providing one unified model across all sub-spatial dimensions.


## Usage
...





## Dataset
The dataset is `Tiny Imagenet`, consisting of 100,000 training images across 200 classes at a resolution of 64x64.

To download the data.
```
python dataset/fetch.py
```

And to process the files into the working dataset.
```
python dataset/process.py
```
